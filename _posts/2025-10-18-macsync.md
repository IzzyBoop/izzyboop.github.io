description: Most stealers are just 3 AMOS's in a trench coat, but this one's just wearing an AMOS t-shirt. No, not that Amos.

# Introduction

On **October 17th, 2025** I was looking through some malicious activity detected on a MacOS host. While giving it a gander my colleague Tony sent me a link to the very same detection, mentioned it looked like **MacSync**, and shared some _possibly related_ `applescript`. 

The purpose of this blog will be to:
- Review the observed attack timeline
- Rip apart the related applescript
- A feeble attempt to determine whether or not this is actually MacSync
- Answer the burning question: Is it just AMOS again or something new?

# The Attack Timeline

# The AppleScript

> Caveat: I will be sharing bits and pieces of the AppleScript here, however, since the script is very long, malicious, and fairly new, I would like to avoid just yeeting it in its entirety into the internet ether.

The first thing I do for every single AppleScript file I come across is a `Command + F` for `system_profiler` to quickly find whether or not the script in question does basic VM checks. This one does:

{% raw %}
```applescript
set result to (do shell script "system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType SPHardwareDataType SPDisplaysDataType")
```
{: file="new 9.osdscript" .nolineno }
{% endraw %}

If we wanted to execute this script for some dynamic analysis efforts, we could simply remove this line from the script. If this were a compiled binary, that's a whole different story (something something binja something). Lucky for us, simply reading the script can shine light on almost everything we need.

# Is it MacSync?

# Is it AMOS?

# Conclusion
