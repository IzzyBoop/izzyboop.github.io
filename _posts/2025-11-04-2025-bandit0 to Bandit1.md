## Introduction

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners to learn more about the linux command line. Please take a moment to read the [bandit landing page.](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

Bandit `Level 0` is intentionally tiny, it gets you comfortable with connecting to a remote machine using `ssh` and using basic file inspection commands. In this writeup we’ll go over the exact steps to sign in to the Bandit server, locate the challenge file, and extract the `Level 1` password. Along the way we’ll explain which commands we used and why. 

Enough yappin', let's get into it!

## Level 0

Relevant Commands: `ssh`

The very first challenge tells us we need to connect to the game using `ssh` and provides us with some important information regarding this connection:

> The host to which you need to connect is `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`, on port `2220`. The username is `bandit0` and the password is `bandit0`.

If you are new to `ssh` the first thing we should do is check the tools `man` page using `man ssh` in your terminal for some detailed documentation (press `q` to exit the man page, you can scroll up and down with `enter`, `up` and `down` arrows, `pgup` and `pgdn` keys, etc).

```terminal
NAME
     ssh – OpenSSH remote login client

SYNOPSIS
     ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file] [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
         [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-P tag] [-p port] [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] destination [command [argument ...]]
     ssh [-Q query_option]

DESCRIPTION
     ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections,
     arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity to the remote machine using one of several methods (see
     below).

     If a command is specified, it will be executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.  A complete command line may be specified as command, or it may have additional arguments.  If supplied, the arguments will be appended to the command,
     separated by spaces, before it is sent to the server to be executed.

     The options are as follows:

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent such as ssh-agent(1).  This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.

... etc.
```

For a shorter help page, we can just type `ssh`

```terminal
[izzyboop] ~ >
> ssh
usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address]
           [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file]
           [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
           [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
           [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-P tag] [-p port] [-R address]
           [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
           destination [command [argument ...]]
       ssh [-Q query_option]
```

So the info we need to provide is the username, the destination host address, the port, and the password. If we look at the usage above, we see that the `-p` flag is for providing the port, the format for this flag to provide our port `2220` is `-p 2220`. There is also a flag `-l` for login name. We can provide the username with this flag or append it to the `destination` address in the format `user@destination`. The full command to connect is:

```terminal

[izzyboop] ~ >
> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

After pressing enter, you will be prompted for a password, type in `bandit0` and press enter. You will not see any characters being typed in the password field of `ssh` prompts. This is normal.

```terminal

[izzyboop] ~ >
> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _

Welcome to OverTheWire!

-- [Truncated information you should read] --

bandit0@bandit:~$
```

You'll be met with a login banner with lots of helpful information about this game and server. I suggest reading it. You'll notice you now have a new commandline prompt `bandit0@bandit:~$`. We are now connected to `bandit0` as a non-root user which is denoted by the `$` at the end. If we were root, we would see a `#`. (If you are unfamiliar, `root` is (in simple terms) the linux version of a windows `local admin`. (There are differences and it's not a direct 1:1, but it's a good enough comparison for the purposes of this game. Don't come at me, linux dorks.))

Now that we are connected, we have technically beaten `Level 0`! We can move on to `Level 0 -> Level 1`.

## Level 0 -> Level 1

Let's take a look at the [Level 0 -> Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) landing page to gather some info on the goal and expectations.

> The password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory. Use this password to log into `bandit1` using `SSH`. Whenever you find a password for a level, use `SSH` (on port `2220`) to log into that level and continue the game.

Okay. Looks like we need to find the password for the next level in a file within our home directory. We can then use that password on the same port as before, `2220`. 

The landing page also lists some commands we may find useful for this challenge:

- ls
- cd
- cat
- file
- du
- find

I suggest looking up the `man` pages or usage of each of these commands to familiarize yourself with them. These are all basic commands that will be very helpful for the remaining levels of this game. 

For instance, let's check out the `ls` command. (some commands use `-h`, some use `--help`, some (like `ssh`) use no flag to display usage, while all (or most) commands have a `man` page we can look at. If all else fails, google is your friend.)

```terminal
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls --help
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them;
                             e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below

... etc etc
```

The help page for the `ls` command is long, but we can see that it is a tool to `List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default)` and the syntax is `ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...`. The option and file are optional, if we just type `ls` into the terminal we can list the names and directories in our current working directory.

```terminal
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```

My personal go-to flags for the `ls` command are `-l`, `-a`, and `-h` which can all be joined into `-lah` (This is not applicable to all flags for all tools, read their `man` pages to see which flags can be stacked.)

If we look into the `man` page we can see what each of these flags do:

- `-1   list one file per line`
- `-a, --all    do not ignore entries starting with .` (shows hidden files and directories)
- `-h, --human-readable    with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.`

```terminal
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls -lah
total 24K
drwxr-xr-x   2 root    root    4.0K Oct 14 09:26 .
drwxr-xr-x 150 root    root    4.0K Oct 14 09:29 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 root    root     220 Mar 31  2024 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--   1 root    root    3.8K Oct 14 09:19 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--   1 root    root     807 Mar 31  2024 .profile
-rw-r-----   1 bandit1 bandit0  438 Oct 14 09:26 readme
```

The first sentence of this challenge told us the password would be stored in a file called `readme` and here we see a file with that name.
