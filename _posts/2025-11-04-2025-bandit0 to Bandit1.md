## Introduction

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners to learn more about the linux command line. Please take a moment to read the [bandit landing page.](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

Bandit `Level 0` is intentionally tiny, it gets you comfortable with connecting to a remote machine using `ssh` and using basic file inspection commands. In this writeup we’ll go over the exact steps to sign in to the Bandit server, locate the challenge file, and extract the `Level 1` password. Along the way we’ll explain which commands we used and why. 

Enough yappin', let's get into it!
