> DANGER: Izzy out of containment
{: .prompt-danger }

Hiya! I'm Izzy! ^_^ Listen, I have no idea how to talk about myself so this is gonna be a mess.

I currently work as a Threat Hunter for a well known MDR but fill my spare time researching the MacOS security landscape and slamming my face against ARM assembly. I have a non-zero amount of experience in malware analysis, threat intelligence, threat research, and various other parts of the same job that we collectively decided to section-off and give their own names. (I'm a generalist and prefer to keep it that way.) Prior to my current employment I was a SOC Analyst, IR (this was fun), wore many hats at an MSP, had a few years working with CADD software, was a welder (anodized aluminum TIG), a bartender (gay bar because duh), and worked in food service. (All this to say, I have experience handling walls of bullshit being flung at my face.) (Should I parenthesize more things? Is parenthesize a word?)

My formal education is meaningless. I initially went to college for Film VFX but that school was so incredibly abysmal I transferred to DeVry just to finish my bachelor's, then convinced myself I should just go work in tech. Now, several years later, I'm on the fence about whether or not to pursue my master's in cybersecurity. (Something something success through persistence something?)

I am also a member of the [DeTraced](https://detraced.org) cybersecurity research team. They're very neato and fun to work with. ^_^

In my free time outside of tech I can often be found playing guitar (primarily 7 and 8 string because dj0nt), playing some sort of video game (`Control`{: .filepath } and `silksong`{: .filepath } at the time of writing (she silk my song til... my knight is... hollow?)), reading cute webcomics, creepypastas, and _new weird_ stories (`I Am the Grim Reaper`{: .filepath } and the `Southern Reach`{: .filepath } series are two faves), chasing drift cars with custom-built FPV drones ([@izzyboop_fpv on IG](https://www.instagram.com/izzyboop_fpv/)), or elbow-deep in the engine bay of some random Subaru while listening to Creed and cursing whatever malevolent god allowed the Subaru boxer engine to exist.

My dream is to one day quit cybersecurity forever and open up a queer-friendly coffee shop.

Uh, I think that's it? Sure, whatever, I'm sleepy anyway. K bai~~
